# excel_sales_dashboard
This project showcases an interactive Sales Dashboard built using Microsoft Excel, designed to analyze and visualize business sales data in a clear, insightful, and decision-driven manner. The objective of this project is to demonstrate practical Excel skills commonly required in Data Analyst, MIS Executive, Business Analyst, and Operations roles.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance across multiple dimensions such as time, region, product category, and individual products. A synthetic sales dataset was created and structured to simulate real-world business data, ensuring the project closely reflects actual industry use cases.

The dataset includes key attributes like Order ID, Order Date, Product, Category, Region, Quantity, Unit Price, and Total Amount. The raw data was first converted into an Excel Table, cleaned, formatted, and then processed using PivotTables and PivotCharts to generate meaningful summaries and trends.

The dashboard features several key performance indicators (KPIs) including Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value, and Best Performing Region. These KPIs help stakeholders quickly assess overall business health at a glance. Visualizations such as monthly sales trend charts, product-wise revenue comparisons, and region-wise sales distributions are included to support deeper analysis.

To enhance usability, interactive slicers and timelines have been added, allowing users to dynamically filter the dashboard by region, category, and time period. All visuals and KPIs update automatically based on the selected filters, making the dashboard highly interactive and user-friendly.

This project highlights strong proficiency in:

Excel data cleaning and structuring

PivotTables and PivotCharts

Dashboard design and layout

Business-focused data storytelling

KPI creation and automation

Overall, this Excel Sales Dashboard demonstrates the ability to transform raw data into actionable business insights and serves as a strong portfolio project for showcasing analytical and reporting skills using Excel.
